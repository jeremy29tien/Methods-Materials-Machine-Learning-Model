RAT-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37Â°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA or siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, cells were washed once with PBS and starved by 3 h of incubation in DMEM without FBS. Afterwards cells were exposed to 20% FBS to induce c-Fos expression. Cells were either lysed for Western blotting or fixed for immunofluorescence staining 1 h after addition of FBS.

The GIE2 cell line (G1E) is a GATA1 null proliferating committed erythroid progenitor cell line. The derived G1E-ER4 cells express a Gata1-estrogen receptor (ER) transgene and upon estradiol or tamoxifen treatment undergo synchronous differentiation recapitulating early stages of erythroid differentiation (44, 45). Cells were maintained in culture as previously described (46). MEL and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. Expression plasmids carrying genes for murine Ik1, Ik1Δex6, Ik4, Ik6, GATA1, GATA2, GATA3, Cdk9, and Cdk9dn (D167N) were constructed by subcloning the relevant cDNA sequences (with or without Flag-hemagglutinin [HA] tags [FH] at their N-terminal regions) in cytomegalovirus- or simian virus 40-based vectors. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with FuGene HD reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and harvested after 48 h. Cdk9dn and Ik1Δex6 mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. To generate G1E cells stably expressing Ik6-FH proteins, 3 million cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution R and transfected with 10 μg of linearized and endotoxin-free Maxi-prep DNA (Qiagen) by using the G-016 program with the Nucleofector II system (Amaxa Biosystems). Electroporation was carried out with linearized empty pOZN-FH-N (mock) or pOZN-FH-N-Ik6 (pOZN-Ik6) vector (20, 47) containing Ik6 fused to Flag and hemagglutinin tags. Selection of transfected cells was carried out by magnetic affinity sorting with antibody against the interleukin-2 receptor, the surface selection marker, as reported by Nakatani et al. (47), and screened by Western blotting with HA antibody.

Primary culture of murine proximal tubular cells was performed as previously described (19, 20). Briefly, 3-week-old mice were sacrificed, their kidneys were removed, and cortices were harvested. Individual cortical samples were minced and digested by collagenase IV (1 mg/ml) and then plated onto culture dishes in a renal epithelial cell growth medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany). Cultures of cells that exhibited proximal tubule characteristics were maintained for 5 to 7 days in 5% CO2 at 37°C (19, 20). HEK293NT lentiviral packaging cells (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with high-glucose medium (Life Technologies BRL, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% bovine serum and 10% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.

E14tg2a (E14) mESCs were cultured without a feeder layer in mESC culture medium with 100 IU/ml mouse leukemia-inhibiting factor (mLIF) (ESGRO; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following procedures described earlier (20). Undifferentiated ESCs from Eed−/− mice (a kind gift from Terry Magnuson) were maintained on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with the mESC medium with twice the concentration of mLIF (i.e., 200 IU/ml). mTSCs were derived following previously described procedures (21). Blastocysts from 6-week-old female 129S2/SvPasCrl (129/Sv) strain mice (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) were isolated at 3.5 days postcoitum and transferred on irradiated MEFs to mTSC culture medium consisting of RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Cellgro; Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA), 2 mM l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 mg/ml, respectively) in the presence of 25 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4; Invitrogen), and heparin (1 μg/ml; Sigma). Blastocyst outgrowths were disaggregated after 5 to 7 days, and a female TSC line, confirmed by a lack of sex-determining region Y (Sry) expression (data not shown), was selected for subsequent experiments. For experimental purposes, mTSCs were expanded in the proliferative state without MEF feeders by culturing in the presence of MEF-conditioned medium and normal mTSC medium (as described above) in a ratio of 7:3 (22). Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Transfection of HEK293T cells was done in a similar medium devoid of antibiotics.

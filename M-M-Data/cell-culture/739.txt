Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were cultured in Eagle minimal essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY), sodium pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). Human hepatocellular carcinoma Bel-7402 cells, a human normal hepatic immortal cell line (HL-7702), and acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (vol/vol) FBS. For differentiation to macrophages, THP-1 cells were cultured at a density of 200,000 cells per cm2 and stimulated with 160 nM phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 24 h. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (high glucose; Invitrogen)–F-12K (1:1) containing 10% (vol/vol) FBS. The cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.

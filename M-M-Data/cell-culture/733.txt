HEK293T, HeLa, U2OS, U2OS SCR24, MCF7, skin fibroblast IBR3, A-T, and ATR Seckel cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. All plasmid transfections for stable and transient expression were performed using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulsar X cell (250 V and 950 μF). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines.

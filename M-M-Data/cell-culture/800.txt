Primary mouse chondrocytes were isolated from 0.5-day-old wt and Adam17−/− mouse articular cartilage by following a slightly modified version of a previous protocol for isolation of chondrocytes from P5 animals (39). Passage 0 to 2 murine primary chondrocytes were plated at 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)–F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1× ITS universal culture supplement (containing insulin, transferrin, and selenous acid; BD Biosciences), and 50 μg/ml of ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and were maintained in culture for the indicated times with medium changes every 48 h. For pellet cultures, 5 × 105 wt or Adam17−/− primary chondrocytes were pelleted in two sequential centrifugations (5 min at 4°C, 1000 × g) and maintained in culture for 1 and 3 weeks in 500 ml of DMEM–F-12 containing 10% FBS, 1× ITS, and 50 μg/ml of ascorbic acid, with medium changes every 48 h. The hypertrophic differentiation and mineralization of chondrocytes was assessed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis and alizarin red staining (Sigma-Aldrich). Alizarin red staining was quantified by counting the number of positively staining nodules per well. The number of nodules seen in a wt well was set to one for each experiment and used to calculate the fold difference in the number of nodules generated by Adam17−/− chondrocytes. Protein ectodomain shedding experiments with transfected alkaline phosphatase-tagged EGFR ligands were performed as described previously (12, 40).

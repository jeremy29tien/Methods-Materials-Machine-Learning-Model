Wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), Arf−/− ear fibroblasts, Arf−/− MEFs, p53−/− MEFs, p53−/−; Mdm2−/− MEFs, and p53−/−; Mdm2−/−; Arf−/− MEFs were isolated from C57BL/6/Sv129 mixed mice. BxPC-3, Capan-2, Miapaca-2, and Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cell lines were kindly provided by Andrea Wang-Gillam (Washington University), BeaS2B cells were provided by Gregory Longmore (Washington University), and H441 and A549 lung cancer cells were provided by Steven Brody (Washington University). BxPC-3 and H441 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with antibiotics and supplements (10 mmol of HEPES, 4.5 g of glucose, 2 mmol of l-glutamine, and 1 mmol of sodium pyruvate/liter). A549 cells were grown in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All other cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All cell lines were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. U0126 and LY294002 were purchased from Sigma. Rapamycin was purchased from LC laboratories.

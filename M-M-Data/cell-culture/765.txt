RAW 264.7 macrophages were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). RAW 264.7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (HyClone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. To differentiate 3T3-L1 cells, they were grown to confluence and stimulated with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, dexamethasone (1 μM), methylisobutylxanthine (520 μM), and insulin (167 nM) for 48 h. Then, the culture medium was exchanged for DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and insulin (167 nM) for another 48 h, and 3T3-L1 cells were maintained with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum.

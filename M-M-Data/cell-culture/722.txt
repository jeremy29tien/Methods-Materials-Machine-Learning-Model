HEK293 cells and L6 myoblasts were grown and maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) or low-glucose α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza). As the ability of myoblast fusion into myotubes declines with passage, cells were used at low passages (≤6) for all experiments. The medium was switched to α-MEM with 2% (vol/vol) FBS for differentiation and was replaced every 2 days. Atrophy experiments were initiated on day 8, when myotubes were of constant size and myotube fusion ceased.

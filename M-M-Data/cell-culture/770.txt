Human primary proximal-tubule cells were prepared as previously described (13). Both primary and RPTEC/TERT1 (14) cells were cultured in hormonally defined medium that consisted of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; catalog no. 11966; Invitrogen) and Ham's F-12 nutrient mix (catalog no. 21765; Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mM Glutamax (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 ng/ml epithelial growth factor, and 36 ng/ml hydrocortisone. Routinely, cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes (Sarstedt) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and subcultured by trypsinization. Medium was replaced three times per week, and the volumes were 2 ml for 6 wells, 10 ml for 10-cm dishes, and 1 ml for coverslips. RPTEC/TERT1 cells were used at passages 76 to 100. Primary cells were used at passage 3. For studying epithelial monolayer formation, cells were freshly seeded to a density of 30% surface area and followed over the following 16-day interval. Medium was replaced every day.

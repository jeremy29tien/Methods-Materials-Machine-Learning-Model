HEK293 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Rce1−/−, Icmt−/−, and Icmt+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were kindly provided by S. G. Young (UCLA). Plasmid DNAs were transiently transfected into HEK293 and HeLa cells using Effectene (Qiagen). For MEFs, Lipofectamine 2000 or retroviral infection was used.

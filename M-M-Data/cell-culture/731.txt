3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum (CS), 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. After differentiation, the CS was replaced by fetal bovine serum (FBS). SiRNA transfection in 3T3-L1 cells was performed using DharmaFECT (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) as instructed. For adenovirus infection, the virus (1 × 106 PFU) was added to the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes 24 h before isobutylmethylxanthine-dexamethasone-insulin (MDI) induction. PIKE−/− and Fyn−/− MEF were isolated from an E13.5 embryo using trypsin digestion as previously described (21). The cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Electroporation of 3T3-L1 or MEF cells (50 μg DNA/2 × 106 cells) was performed at 0.95 kV, 200 Ω, and 25 μF using the Gene Pulser II system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

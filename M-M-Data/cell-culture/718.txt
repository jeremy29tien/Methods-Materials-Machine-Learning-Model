Drosophila S2R+ cells were grown and maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were then treated with double-stranded RNAi as previously described (6). Briefly, primers for 300- to 600-bp fragments of target sequences were designed using PrimerQuest software (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Control double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting green fluorescent protein (GFP) was designed. PCR products, flanked at their 5′ and 3′ ends by T7 sequences, were generated using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and dsRNA was produced by in vitro transcription using MEGAscript T7 kits (Ambion, Austin, TX). Drosophila S2R+ cells were plated, and cultured in six-well tissue culture plates overnight before transfection with 500 ng dsRNA using Effectene reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and incubated for 3 days. Several primer sets were designed for each candidate, and cells were transfected with dsRNA and tested for knockdown efficiency (see below). dsRNA resulting in 85 to 100% knockdown of candidate proteins or RNA after 3 days was used for all subsequent experiments. For live-cell time-lapse imaging, cells were transfected with 1 μg of pMT EB1-GFP (a generous gift of Steve Rogers, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) 24 h before imaging, using the same protocol used to transfect dsRNA.

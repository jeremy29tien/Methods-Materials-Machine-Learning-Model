Primary bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated from thoracic aortas and maintained in culture using previously described methods (12). Mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAEC) were purchased from Angio-Proteomie (Boston, MA) and cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Smad3 knockout and wild-type embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were isolated from newborn mice and kept in culture using standard procedures (13). Tetracycline (Tet)-inducible human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells stably expressing LOXL4-green fluorescent protein (GFP) constructs were generated and maintained in culture according to protocols previously published (14).

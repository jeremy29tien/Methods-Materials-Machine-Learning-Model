Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of HA-tagged ARF6 mutants, MDCKARF6(Q67L) and MDCKARF6(T27N), were grown as described previously (40). MDCKARF6si cells, with inducible expression of ARF6 small interfering RNA (siRNA), were grown as described previously (41). Parental L cells and L cells expressing Wnt3A (L-Wnt3A) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Conditional media (CM) with or without Wnt3A were collected as described previously (42). Wnt3A-CM was used as the source of Wnt3A. In all experiments utilizing Wnt3A-CM, control experiments were conducted using with CM from parental L cells. Three-dimensional cultures of MDCK and MCF-10A cysts were carried out as described previously (43). To activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, Wnt3A was added 48 h postseeding to developing cysts. PD98059 (25 μg/ml), dynasore (100 μM), or TBB (10 μM) was added at day 4 of cyst formation, and the medium was replaced every 24 h. For every set of experimental conditions, at least 150 cysts were visualized.

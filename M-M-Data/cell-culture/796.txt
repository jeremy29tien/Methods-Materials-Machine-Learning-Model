The primary HMEC line, immortalized using the retrovirus pBabe-hygro-hTERT (hygro stands for hygromycin, and hTERT stands for human telomerase reverse transcriptase), was cultured as previously described (16). SUM149 and SUM229 breast cancer cells were cultured in HuMEC medium (Life Technologies; catalog no. 12752-010) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (PS) plus bovine pituitary extract and HuMEC supplement or Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% FBS, 1% PS plus 5 μg/ml insulin and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, respectively. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high-glucose medium with 10% FBS and 1% PS. Transfection of 293T cells was performed in 15-cm dishes for 24 h with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The Smarcd3/Snail/Slug Gateway entry plasmid was subcloned into a lentiviral FLAG-Gateway destination vector. The lentiviral FLAG-Gateway destination vector was a kind gift from Ben Major.

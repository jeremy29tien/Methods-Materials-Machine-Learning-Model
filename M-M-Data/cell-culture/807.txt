Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; provided by Joslin Media Core) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and grown on culture dishes precoated with 0.2% gelatin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The cells were used at less than passage 5. Mouse lung endothelial cells (LEC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 mg/liter of heparin, and 50 mg/liter of endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS). The procedure for isolation of lung endothelial cells from mice was previously described (7).

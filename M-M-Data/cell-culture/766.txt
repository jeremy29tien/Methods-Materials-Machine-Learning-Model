Sodium arsenite, tBHQ, insulin, transferrin, dexamethasone, trypsin inhibitor, and the antibody against LC3 were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. l-Sulforaphane was used in all experiments and was purchased from LKT Laboratories, Inc. Primary antibodies specifically against Nrf2, Keap1, p62, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and β-actin as well as mouse, rabbit, and goat horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Alexa Fluor 488, 594, and 680 were purchased from Invitrogen. HEK293, NIH 3T3, and BEAS-2B cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-LC3-expressing immortalized baby mouse kidney (iBMK) cells were established in the laboratory of Eileen White (Cancer Institute of New Jersey). The 16HBE14o− (HBE) cell line was obtained from the California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, CA. NIH 3T3 and iBMK cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% l-glutamine, and 0.01% gentamicin. BEAS-2B cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (MediaTech) supplemented with 1 ml bovine hypothalamus extract (PromoCell), insulin (2 mg/ml) (Sigma), transferrin (2.5 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich), dexamethasone (0.05 mM) (Sigma), cholera toxin (10 μg/ml) (List Biological Laboratories, Inc.), and epidermal growth factor (10 μg/ml) (Millipore). HBE cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% l-glutamine, and 0.01% gentamicin. HEK293 cells were grown in the same medium as HBE cells and were supplemented with 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (Cellgro) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco). All cell lines were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.

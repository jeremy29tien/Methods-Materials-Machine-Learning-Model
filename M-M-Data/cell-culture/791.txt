MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-436, human embryonic kidney HEK293, and 293M cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% standard fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2.5 mM l-glutamine, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin. MCF10A, MCF7, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-453, and HEK293 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). 293M cells are a 293 derivative established in the laboratory for their high expression of pS62-Myc. The LY2 cell line was a gift from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. MCF10A cells were grown in 45% DMEM, 45% Ham's F-12, 5% defined FBS, 2.5 mM l-glutamine, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 μg/ml insulin, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin. MCF7 cells were grown in 45% DMEM, 45% Ham's F-12, 10% FBS, 2.5 mM l-glutamine, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin. LY2 cells were grown in modified Iscove's modified Eagle's medium (IMEM) with 5% FBS, 2.5 mM l-glutamine, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin.

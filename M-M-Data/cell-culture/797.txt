HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C in 5% CO2. The cells were detached and suspended at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml in phenol red-free MEM containing 10% FBS 24 h before the experiments. Subsequently, 30-μl aliquots were plated into 384-well microwell plates (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) that had been coated with 33-fold-diluted phenol red-free Matrigel matrix (BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA) for 30 min, and then the cells were cultured overnight. One hour before the microscopy experiments, the culture medium was exchanged for phenol red-free X-Vivo-10 containing 4% FBS. The single-molecule microscopy experiments to visualize TatP-QDs were performed at 37°C. The transfection of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged expression vectors was performed using Fugene HD (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cholesterol was partially depleted from the plasma membrane by incubating the cells in 4 mM methyl-β-cyclodextrin (24, 33). This treatment did not decrease the surface expression of HSPGs on HeLa cells, as previously described (24).

MCF10A human breast epithelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)–F-12 containing 5% horse serum (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml of insulin (Sigma), 0.5 μg/ml of hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 100 ng/ml of cholera toxin (Sigma) as described previously (26). COS7 monkey kidney cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum with antibiotics. For ephrinA1 stimulation, MCF10A cells were starved for 4 h in serum-free DMEM–F-12 medium and COS7 and 293 cells were starved overnight in serum-free DMEM and then were stimulated with 0.1 to 1.0 μg/ml ephrinA1 for the times indicated below.

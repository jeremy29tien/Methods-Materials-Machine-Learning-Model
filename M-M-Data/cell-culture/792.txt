C57BL/6 Ctns−/− mice were described before (35). Neonatal skin fibroblasts from Ctns−/− and wild-type mice were prepared by standard procedures (36). Neonatal murine fibroblasts and 293T cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Human renal proximal tubular cells (hPTCs) were previously described (37) and were kindly provided by Corinne Antignac. All studies were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines and with approval of the animal review board at The Scripps Research Institute.

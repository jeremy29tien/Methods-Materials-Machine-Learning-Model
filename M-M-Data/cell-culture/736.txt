NIH 3T3 and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin. MEFs were cultured in medium supplemented with 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin instead of penicillin and streptomycin. To analyze mRNA or protein stability, cells were treated with 2 μg/ml of actinomycin D or 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX), respectively. To induce adipocytic differentiation, cells were kept confluent for 2 days and switched to differentiation medium (DMEM containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 1 μM dexamethasone, and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine [IBMX; Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO]). For 5-ethynil-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, cells were pulse-labeled with 10 μM EdU for 45 min. Labeled cells were visualized using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor imaging kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).

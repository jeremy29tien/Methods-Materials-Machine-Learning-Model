Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were harvested, used at passages two to five, and maintained as described previously (17, 24). Findings were replicated in HUVEC derived from independent cultures prepared from multiple unrelated individuals. HepG2 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line with epithelial morphology) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mM HEPES. K562 human erythroleukemia cells (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10 mM HEPES. For hypoxia treatment, cells were subjected to 1% O2 in a temperature- and humidity-controlled incubator within a sealed anaerobic system (Thermo Forma model 1025). The hypoxic environment (1% O2) was achieved and maintained using a high-purity anaerobic gas mixture (5% CO2, 10% H2, 85% N2; Linde).

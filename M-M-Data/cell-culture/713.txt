Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 (E18) Sprague-Dawley rat brains. Cells (750/mm2; i.e., 100,000/coverslip) were plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma) (0.1 mg/ml in borate buffer [pH 8.5])-coated glass coverslips. The plating medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin (P/S), and 0.5 mM l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen). On the next day, the medium was changed to Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.5 mM l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen) or with NS21, a homemade supplement prepared as described previously (32). Cultures were routinely used at 14 days in vitro (14DIV).

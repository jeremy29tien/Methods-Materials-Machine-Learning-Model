U-2 OS, A549, and HTC cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)–F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). U-2 OS cells stably expressing wild-type (WT) hGRα were maintained in 0.2 mg/ml Geneticin- and 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen)-containing medium as described previously (33). 3T3L mouse fibroblast cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FCS and 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin. All cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C.

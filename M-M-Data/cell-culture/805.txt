3T3-L1 preadipocytes were propagated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum. To induce differentiation, 2-day postconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (day 0) were fed with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 μM dexamethasone, and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (MIX) until day 2. Cells were then fed with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 μg/ml insulin for 2 days, after which they were fed every other day with DMEM containing 10% FBS. For autophagy inhibition, cells were treated with 0.5 mM 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (Sigma-Aldrich) from the indicated day.

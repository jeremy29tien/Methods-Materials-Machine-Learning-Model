Splenic single-cell suspensions were incubated with an optimal concentration of biotinylated anti-B220 (BD Bioscience). Then magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) MS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) were used to obtain B cells. B220+ Igκ+ Igλ−, B220+ Igκ− Igλ+, and B220+ Igκ− Igλ− B cells from E3′F/F Ed−/− CD23-Cre mice were sorted on a MoFlo machine (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Sorted B220+ Igκ− Igλ− B cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin, l-glutamine, 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 66 ng/ml BAFF at 106 cells/ml for 24 h at 37°C.

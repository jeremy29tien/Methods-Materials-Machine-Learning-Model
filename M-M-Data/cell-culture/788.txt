Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells were grown in Schneider's medium containing l-glutamine (Gibco-BRL) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco-BRL) and penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (100 U/ml, 100 μg/ml, and 0.292 mg/ml, respectively; Gibco BRL). Cells were grown at 25°C in 75-cm2 flasks to 70% confluence and split every 4 days. Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, 3 × 106 cells were transferred to a 25-cm2 flask (∼70% confluence) and transfected with 6 μg of each indicated plasmid. The cells were harvested after 24 h. For pMT plasmids, 12 h after transfection, expression was induced with 500 μM CuSO4 for 24 h and then cells were harvested. Cells were washed once in 1 ml cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and processed immediately afterward.

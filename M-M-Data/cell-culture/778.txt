16HBE14o- (16HBE) cells (a gift of Dieter Gruenert, California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, CA) were cultured in minimal essential medium with GlutaMAX (41090; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; BenchMark; Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA) and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37°C in 5% CO2. For calcium switch experiments, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline three times and incubated in calcium-free medium for 4 h, and then normal growth medium containing calcium was added. Calcium-free medium was Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) without calcium chloride (21068; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS pretreated with Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected (50 nM) in medium without antibiotics and with 5 μl Lipofectamine LTX (15338030; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) per 1.0 × 105 16HBE cells. HEK293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2. For HEK293T cell transfection with plasmid DNA, 3 × 105 cells were transfected with 1 μg plasmid DNA and 5 μl Lipofectamine 2000 (11668-027; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

All yeast strains are derived from W303-1A with corrected RAD5 (20): MATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 RAD5. All deletion strains lack the entire open reading frame. rad53 point mutation alleles were generated as previously described (24, 25). All cultures were grown using YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose), except for sporulations in 1% potassium acetate. Zymolyase 20T (Saikagaku)-digested tetrads were dissected on YPD plates, photographed after 3 to 4 days, and genotyped using auxotrophic markers or PCR and restriction analysis for point mutations. All DNA damage samples were treated with 0.05% methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) for 60 min. For Hug1 induction, cells were treated with 100 mM hydroxyurea for 2 h as described elsewhere (26). Cells were synchronized with 20 μg/ml α-factor for up to 2 h, washed extensively, and released into prewarmed YPD.

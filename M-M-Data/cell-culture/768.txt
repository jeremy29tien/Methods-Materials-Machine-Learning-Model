Wild-type and Capns1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts were previously described (17) and kindly donated by P. Greer (Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada). 293T, Phoenix, U2OS, and BJ-ET cells and the mouse fibroblasts described above were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). U2OS, 293T, and BJ-ET cells were transiently transfected using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) or RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

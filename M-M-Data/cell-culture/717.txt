HeLa, HepG2, HEK293, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and peritoneal macrophages were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Omega Scientific) unless otherwise specified. Primary peritoneal macrophages were obtained from thioglycolate-treated wild-type and IDOL knockout (KO) mice 4 days after injection (6). T-Rex CHO A7 cells were cultured as previously described (19). The embryonic stem (ES) cells were cultured in Glasgow minimum essential medium (GMEM) as previously described (6). GW3965, simvastatin, mevalonic acid, PCSK9 protein, and doxycycline were added to the medium for the times indicated in the figure legends.

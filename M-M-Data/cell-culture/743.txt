Young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells and mouse small intestine epithelium (MSIE) that harbor a heat-labile SV40 large T antigen expressed under the control of a gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-inducible promoter were the kind gift of Robert H. Whitehead (Vanderbilt University Medical Center) (14). The cells are grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% ITS Premix (6.25 mg/liter insulin, 6.25 mg/liter transferrin, 6.25 μg/liter selenous acid, 1.25 g/liter bovine serum albumin, and 5.35 mg/liter linoleic acid) under permissive conditions at 33°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 until confluent. Before all experiments, cells were cultured in IFN-γ-free medium under nonpermissive conditions of 37°C for 24 h. Rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 μg/ml insulin at 37°C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. All the cells were serum starved 24 h before LPA treatment in their appropriate medium without FBS. The pcDNA3.1 plasmids harboring HA-Rac1, HA-Rac1G12V (constitutively active form), HA-Rac1T17N (dominant negative), Glu-Glu-tagged Gαq (EE-Gαq), EE-Gα13, or EE-Gαi were obtained from the Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO). PLC-β clones were gifts from Pann-Ghill Suh (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Republic of Korea). Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Stable expression of LPA1 and LPA2 was achieved by transduction with lentiviral pCDH/VSVG-LPA1 and pCDH/VSVG-LPA2, respectively. Lentiviral pCDH was used as a control. pLKO.1 plasmid harboring shLPA1, shLPA2, shPLC-β1, or shPLC-β2 was obtained from Sigma. pLKO.1-puro was used to generate control lentivirus, shCont. Specified cells transfected with lentivirus were selected by 10 μg/ml puromycin to obtain stably transfected cells. Silencing of gene products was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) or Western blot.

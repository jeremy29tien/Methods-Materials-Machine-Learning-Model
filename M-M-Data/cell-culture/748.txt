A549 and Beas-2B cells were grown in high-glucose Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing l-glutamine and supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (pen-strep) and 5% or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone), respectively. Cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37°C. For reporter assays, ∼4 × 104 cells were plated per well in 48-well dishes. The next day, cells were transfected as indicated in the Results with firefly luciferase plasmids and the Renilla luciferase (RL) expression vector pSV40-RL (Promega) at a ratio of 10:1 or with a combination of firefly luciferase plasmids, pcDNA-KLF15 (or pcDNA control), and pSV40-RL at a ratio of 5:5:1 by adding 50 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) per plasmid DNA (400 ng total) complex to cells cultured in 250 μl of DMEM containing pen-strep and FBS. For siRNA studies, cells were cotransfected with firefly and Renilla luciferase plasmids in combination with a 25 nM concentration of siKLF15 (or siCtrl) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies). Approximately 18 h later, cells were treated with 100 nM dex or vehicle in fresh complete medium or serum-free medium, as indicated for starvation experiments, for 8 h. Cells were then lysed, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luminescence was detected from 10 μl lysate using an Infinite M1000 plate reader (Tecan). Relative luciferase activity was obtained after normalization of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity. Each experiment was performed in biologic quadruplicate and repeated at least once with qualitatively similar results. P values indicated in the figure legends were calculated using t tests and nonparametric tests.

IHH and HepaRG cells were cultured and stimulated with 11 mM and 25 mM glucose, respectively, as described previously (31, 33, 34). For some experiments, as indicated below, IHH cells were pretreated for 1 h with trichostatin A (TSA) (300 Î¼g/ml) before incubation with glucose. IHH cells were transfected with plasmids using Jet PEI (QBiogene, Illkirch, France) in Williams E (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) medium for 16 h and then stimulated with glucose. IHH and HepaRG cells were transfected as previously described (31, 35) with the following small interfering RNAs (siRNAs): OnTargetPlus SmartPools, scramble control (product no. D-001810; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), FXR (product no. L-003414; Dharmacon), ChREBP (product no. L-009253; Dharmacon), CBP (product no. L-003477; Dharmacon), and p300 (product no. L-003486; Dharmacon) siRNAs; siGenome SmartPools scramble control (product no. D-001206; Dharmacon); and SMRT siRNA (product no. M-020145; Dharmacon).

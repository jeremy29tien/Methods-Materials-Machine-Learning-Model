HEK293 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. Wild-type and Gab2-deficient MEFs were described elsewhere (25). MCF-10A cells were cultured in DMEM–F-12 medium with growth medium (supplemented with 5% [vol/vol] horse serum [Invitrogen], 20 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor [EGF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN], 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone [Sigma], 100 ng/ml cholera toxin [Sigma], 10 μg/ml bovine insulin [Sigma], 50 U/ml penicillin G [Invitrogen], and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate [Invitrogen]). Gab2-deficient MEFs and MCF-10A stable cell lines were generated using pBabe-puro-derived retroviral particles, and expressing cells were selected using puromycin (2 μg/ml). HEK293 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described (26). Cells were grown for 24 h after transfection and serum starved using serum-free DMEM where indicated for 16 to 18 h. Starved cells were pretreated with PD184352 (10 μM), U0126 (20 μM), or BI-D1870 (10 μM) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), where indicated, and stimulated with FBS (10%), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 25 to 100 ng/ml), or EGF (25 ng/ml) before being harvested. Unless indicated otherwise, all drugs and growth factors were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). The proliferation rate was measured by the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay.

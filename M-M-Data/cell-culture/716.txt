CH12F3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol. For the CSR assay, healthy CH12F3 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/ml in the presence of 1 μg/ml anti-CD40 antibody (eBioscience 16-0402-86), 5 ng/ml of interleukin-4 (IL-4) (R&D Systems 404-ML), and 0.5 ng/ml transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) (R&D Systems 240-B), and grown for 72 h. Cells were stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgA antibody (BD Biosciences 559354) and analyzed on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). CSR efficiency is determined as the percentage of IgA-positive cells.

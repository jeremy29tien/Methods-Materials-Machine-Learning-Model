Two hESC lines, H1 (NIH code WA01) and H13 (NIH code WA13), were cultured without feeders under conditioned medium as described previously (27). Random differentiation was induced in these two cell lines as reported previously using differentiation medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum (28, 29). Cells were collected after differentiation at either 21 or 90 days for each cell line. Lineage-specific differentiation to fibroblasts was induced in H1 hESCs as a stable population according to a published protocol (30). Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from hESC-derived fibroblasts as previously described using a linked Oct4-Sox2 lentiviral vector (31). For all the experiments including in vitro differentiation and reprogramming, at least two biological replicates were performed.

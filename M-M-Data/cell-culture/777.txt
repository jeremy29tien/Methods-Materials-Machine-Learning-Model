Whole livers were collected from mouse fetuses at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), and single-cell suspensions were prepared by successive passage through 25-gauge needles. The fetal liver cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Wako, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 20% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, and 50 ng/ml recombinant human thrombopoietin (TPO) (generously provided by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Megakaryocytes were harvested for RNA purification and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay from a day 3 culture. All of the samples processed from primary megakaryocytes were compared among littermates.

Immature female Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA) and housed in the Biological Resources Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Animals were treated in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (28), and all protocols were approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago Animal Care Committee. Primary granulosa cells were isolated from immature rats treated with E2 (1.5 mg/day for 3 days) and cultured for 96 h as previously described (20). Culture media and treatments were renewed every 48 h.

H1299 human lung carcinoma cells and MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin. HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For transfection, H1299 and HT-1080 cells were plated at 80 to 90% confluence the day before transfection and were subsequently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. MCF-7 cells (2 × 106) were transfected with plasmids for the expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) using the Nucleofector V kit (Amaxa), program Q-28.

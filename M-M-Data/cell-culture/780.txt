All procedures to isolate preimplantation embryos from mouse, rat, and monkey were performed after obtaining IACUC approvals at the University of Kansas Medical Center and the University of Wisconsinâ€”Madison. Human preimplantation embryos were collected at Stanford University, obeying all the institutional rules: a two-stage consent process (23) along with the approval from institutional committees at both Stanford University and the University of Kansas Medical Center. Deidentified and discarded human blastocysts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solutions and analyzed for the H3K27Me3 mark by immunostaining. Embryos isolated from other species are described below.

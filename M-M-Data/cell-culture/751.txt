Cortical neurons were prepared from newborn Wistar rats at postnatal day 0 (P0) as described previously (39). Briefly, dissociated cortical neurons were plated at a density of 106 cells/ml in basal medium Eagle (BME) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (BCS), 35 mM glucose, 1 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. On the second day after seeding, 2 days in vitro (2 DIV), cytosine arabinoside (2.5 Î¼M) was added to cultures to inhibit proliferation of nonneuronal cells. Cells were used for experiments at 6 to 7 DIV unless indicated otherwise. Transient transfections were performed at 4 to 5 DIV (for 72 or 48 h, respectively) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For gelatin zymography analysis neurons were cultured in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen).

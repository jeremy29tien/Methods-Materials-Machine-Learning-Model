Synovial tissue samples were obtained from 10 patients with active RA and 10 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who were currently undergoing synovectomy or joint replacement. RA was diagnosed according to the 1987 revised criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (formerly the American Rheumatism Association). To isolate fibroblasts, synovial tissues were diced into small pieces and digested overnight with 1 mg/ml of type I collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). Primary cultured synovial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described previously (15). Cells from passages 3 to 7 were used in the experiments. This work was approved by the Institutional Review Committee of the Catholic Medical Center, Catholic University of Korea. Informed consent for the use of human synovial tissues was obtained from all of the study subjects. Akt1+/+/Akt2+/+ (wild-type [WT]) and Akt1−/−/Akt2−/− (double-knockout) mice were kindly provided by Sun Sik Bae (Pusan National University) (16). Embryos were dissected from a pregnant double heterozygote Akt1/Akt2 (Akt1+/−/Akt2+/−) female that had been bred with a double heterozygote Akt1/Akt2 (Akt1+/−/Akt2+/−) male. The yolk sacs, heads, and internal organs were isolated and used for genotyping by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Carcasses were treated with trypsin-EDTA for 30 min at 37°C, and clumps of cells were disrupted by chopping with scissors. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium [DMEM] supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics) and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2.

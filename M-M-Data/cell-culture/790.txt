Human hepatic HepG2 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2% penicillin-streptomycin, and l-glutamine in 10-cm2 dishes at 37°C in 5% CO2. For gluconeogenesis induction, cells were grown in glucose-free DMEM (Cellgro) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 20 mM sodium lactate, and 2 mM sodium pyruvate in the presence of 100 nM dexamethasone (DXM) and 100 μM 2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3′-5′-monophosphate (Bt2-cAMP) or 1 μM glucagon during 8 and 12 h. For some experiments, 100 nM insulin was added to the cells after 12 h of gluconeogenesis induction for 8 and 12 additional hours.

U2OS, HeLa DR13-9, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Cellgro) with 10% donor calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro). Mcm9-null MEF cells (30) were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), and penicillin-streptomycin and transformed using simian virus 40 T antigen. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences are as follows: siMCM8-ORF, 5′-AGAAGACGCUGAGGAUAUA-3′; siMCM8-UTR, 5′-CAUAUCAGAUGUAGGCAUA-3′; siMCM9, 5′-GAUGACUUAGUGGAUAGUU-3′; siMCM6, 5′-GAAGAGGACGAGTCAGCAT-3′; siRAD51, 5′-GAGCUUGACAAACUACUUC-3′; and siBRCA2, 5′-GAAGAAUGCAGGUUUAAUA-3′. siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen and transfected using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

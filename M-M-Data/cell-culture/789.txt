Rat chondrosarcoma (RCS), OB1, and C3H10T1/2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37°C and 9% CO2. For in vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer), the cells were washed with phosphate-free DMEM and incubated for 6 h with the same medium containing 0.4 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate/6-cm dish. Labeling was stopped by washing the cells twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were lysed in buffer A as described below. PP2A-A scaffolding PR65 subunit with the Strep-tag (IBA BioTagnology) fused to C terminus was amplified from the PR65–Strep-tag III (PR65-StrepIII) plasmid (51) and inserted into pBABEpuro vector between BamHI and EcoRI sites. The individual RCS cell clones were obtained by 2-week selection with puromycin. Retroviral vector expressing p107SC-FLAG was stably introduced into RCS cells (24). A PCR fragment from GST-p107SC for bacterial infection (22) was inserted between the EcoRI and BamHI sites in the pLXSN vector using the following primers: 5′-TATAGAATTCACCAUGGTTCCTACCTGTGAAGAA-3′ and 5′-TATAGGATCCTTACTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAATCATGATTTGCTCTTTCACTGAC-3′ (the sequence for the FLAG tag is underlined). The sequence contains amino acids V585 to N780 fused to Y949 to H1068. RCS cells with empty pLXSN vector were used as a control. The p107S-HA vector was obtained by inserting the PCR fragment from the GST-p107S construct (22) into the pUNO-mcs vector (InvivoGen) between the BamHI and PstI sites using the following primers: 5′-TATAGGATCCACCAUGGTTCCTACCTGTGAAGAAGTTATATTC-3′ and 5′-TATACTGCAGTTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGTTTATTCCAGTTGAATGTACCTC (the sequence for the HA tag is underlined). Plasmids containing the sequence for mutations in the B55α subunit were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RCS cells were transfected with an equal amount of plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated with fibroblast growth factor (FGF1) (10 ng/ml) (a kind gift from M. Mohamadi, New York University [NYU]) and heparin (5 μg/ml) as indicated in the figure legends. Chondrocytes from the ribs of newborn rats were isolated in accordance with the standard procedure (25) and treated with FGF after 48 h for the periods of time indicated in the figures legends. 32 To induce oxidative stress, H2O2 (final concentration of 800 μM in PBS solution) was administered to the RCS cells for the periods of time indicated in the figure legends. Flow cytometry was performed using FACScan (Becton, Dickinson) and analyzed using ModFit LT (Verity Software House) software.

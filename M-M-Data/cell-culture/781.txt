The preparation of cerebellar cultures was performed using a modification of the Papain method as described previously (13). For transient-transfection experiments, freshly isolated cells were electroporated in suspension and plated in Neurobasal plus B-27 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with KCl (25 mM), glutamine (1 mM), and Shh (3 μg/ml) on poly-l-Lys- plus laminin-coated dishes. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing the corresponding treatments, considering this moment as time zero. Electroporation was performed using the Microporator MP-100 (Digital Bio, Seoul, South Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a single pulse of 1,700 V for 20 milliseconds. Neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma cell lines were grown on poly-l-Lys coated dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)–10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and DMEM–F-12–10% FBS, respectively.

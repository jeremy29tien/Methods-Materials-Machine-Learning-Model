HeLa cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium (MEM) (MediaTech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). Two plasmids in which known phosphorylation sites of Hsp27—Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82—had been mutated to either alanine or aspartic acid were used (17); each Hsp27 open reading frame was also linked to an N-terminal FLAG tag. Linearized plasmids were individually transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were selected in 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Gibco) for 3 to 4 weeks.

ES cell lines A3-1 and ZHBTc4 were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes with LIF-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) as described previously (6, 10, 24, 25). Esrrb-expressing ZHBTc4 ES cells were established by introduction of pCAGIP-Flag-Esrrb into ZHBTc4 ES cells and cultured in the presence of 1 Î¼g/ml puromycin (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum.

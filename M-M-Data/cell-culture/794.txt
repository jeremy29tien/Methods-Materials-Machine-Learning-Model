Cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. DAT-hTERT (N125A+T126A) was generated using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. LhTERTL was created by PCR amplification using primers that contain an overhanging loxP sequence (5′-ATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTAT-3′) and was cloned into the XhoI and NcoI sites of pLNCX2 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

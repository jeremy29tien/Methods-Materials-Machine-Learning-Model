Cell lines 293T and MCF-7 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Vectors of Flag-tagged MAVS, hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MAVS, Flag-tagged VDAC1, and Myc-tagged VDAC1 were obtained by cloning the genes into corresponding pcDNA3-based vectors (Invitrogen). Flag-MAVS mutation plasmids were made on the basis of the pcDNA3-Flag-MAVS plasmid with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

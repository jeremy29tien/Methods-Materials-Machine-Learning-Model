HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg of streptomycin sulfate at 37°C in 5% CO2. HUVECs and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) were purchased from Lonza and grown in endothelial cell basal medium (EBM-2) (Lonza) supplemented with FBS and growth factors (Lonza). For growth factor treatments, cells were grown in EBM-2 with 0.1% FBS for 16 to 24 h and then treated with growth factors for the periods indicated in the figure legends.

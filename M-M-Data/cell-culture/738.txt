G1E cells expressing ER-GATA-1 (48) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Gibco) containing 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (penicillin–streptomycin–amphotericin B [Fungizone]) (Gemini Bioproducts), 2 U/ml erythropoietin (Epo), 120 nM monothioglycerol (Sigma), 0.6% conditioned medium from a Kit ligand-producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini Bioproducts), and 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (49) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) containing 5% bovine serum (Gibco) and 5% FBS (Gemini Bioproducts) (50). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) containing 10% FBS (Gemini Bioproducts) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Zfpm1−/− hematopoietic precursor cells (51) were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Gibco) containing 15% FBS (Gemini), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco), and 10 ng/ml interleukin 3 (IL-3) (R&D Systems).

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were derived from H1 and H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (WA01 and WA09; WiCell) by following a protocol described by Seda Tigli (25). Briefly, the hESCs were grown in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM)for 2 weeks and then in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (MSCGM) (Lonza) for 4 days before fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for cells that are CD73 positive and CD45 and CD19 negative. To check for stable MSC markers, they were analyzed to express CD105, CD73, and CD90 and lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79α or CD19, and HLA-DR surface molecules. Cells were also analyzed for expression of BRACHYURY and VIMENTIN by quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR). MSCs were maintained in MSCGM (Lonza), and cells with passage numbers below p10 were used.

HeLa cervical cancer cells and MCF-7 and Hs578T breast cancer cells as well as N2a neuroblastoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). HeLa cells that stably express either short hairpin RNA (shRNA) control or shRNA p21 were generated using HuSH-29 shRNA vectors purchased from OriGene. Cells were cultured at 37Â°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin (all supplements from Sigma-Aldrich).

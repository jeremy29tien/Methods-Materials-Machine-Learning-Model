HeLa, HEK293, and HT-1080 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were induced at the indicated times with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 (PreproTech). The HT-1080-GFP-PML stable cell line was generated by infection of the ecotrope HT1080-E14 cell line (a gift from Eugene Kandel, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, NY) (36, 37) with pBabe-puro green fluorescent protein-labeled PML (GFP-PML) retrovirus. Arsenic (As2O3; A1010; Sigma) was resuspended in NaOH (0.1 M), and cell treatment was performed at a final concentration of 1 μM. Transient transfections of plasmids were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instruction. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection in the HT1080 cell line was performed with the Dharmafect-1 reagent using 50 nM (final concentration) Thermo Scientific Dharmacon siRNA according to the manufacturer's instruction. The following siRNAs from Thermo Scientific were used: siRNA for Ark (siArk; SMARTpool; MQ-007002-01), individual siArk(1) (D-007002-03) and siArk(2) (D-007002-04), individual nontargeting siRNA (siNT; D-001810-02), and siRNA for RNF4 (siRNF4; SMARTpool; M-006557-03). For luciferase assay, HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.2 μg CAGA12-Luc, 0.05 μg TK-Renilla, and increasing amounts of Arkadia constructs up to 0.25 μg. TGF-β was added 24 h after transfection for 8 h before lysis in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Sequential measurements of luciferase and Renilla activity were performed using a dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla activities.

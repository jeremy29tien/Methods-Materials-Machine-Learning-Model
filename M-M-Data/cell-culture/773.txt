293T and SKBR3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 212LN and A549 cells were cultured in a 1:1 mix of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium and RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, respectively. To generate the ASK1- and ING3-expressing cell lines, the retroviral vector pLHCX harboring ASK1 and ING3 was transfected into 212LN cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To knock down endogenous human RSK2, CREB, ASK1, PTK6, and ING3, lentiviruses carrying shRNA were generated by transfecting 293T cells with lentiviral vectors encoding shRNA, pHRCMV8.2ΔR, and cytomegalovirus-vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (CMV-VSVG). Cells were infected with harvested lentivirus for 48 h for transient infection or were selected by 2 μg/ml puromycin for 1 week for stable selection.

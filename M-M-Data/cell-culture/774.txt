Mouse C2C12 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (26). MK2/3-deficient immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated as reported earlier (18). MEFs were transiently transfected at 50 to 80% confluence. Nonmodified branched polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) (4.5 μl of a 1-mg/ml solution) was added to a mixture of 1.5 μg DNA and 90 μl serum- and antibiotic-free Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM), with the subsequent addition of 900 μl serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM (27). Cells were transfected using 1,000 ng of one of the following promoter firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs: a human SERCA2 promoter fragment extending from bp −2577 to +321 (−2577 fragment; +1 indicates the transcription start site), one of several SERCA2 promoter deletion mutants, a porcine MyHCIId/x promoter fragment extending from bp −2742 to +9 (−2.8 fragment) (26), a rabbit MyHCI/β promoter fragment extending from bp −2345 to +99 (−2.4 fragment) (26), or a murine PGC-1α promoter fragment extending from bp −3036 to +119 (−3.0 fragment). In some experiments cells were also cotransfected with one or several of the following plasmids, as indicated in the figures: 750 ng pcDNA3-myc-MK2, 750 ng MK2K76R, 250 ng pcDNA3-MKK6EE, 500 ng pcDNA3.1(-)myc-His-Erg-1, and/or an empty vector(s). Promoter reporter constructs containing deletion mutants of the human SERCA2 promoter fragments (extending from bp −2577, −1741, −412, −263 [−263 fragment], or −68 [−68 fragment] to +321) inserted into pGL2 basic were described previously (28, 29). The expression vectors for wild-type MK2 (pcDNA3-myc-MK2), mutant catalytic-dead, p38α stabilizing MK2, MK2K76R (pcDNA3-myc-MK2K76R), and constitutively active MK2, MK2EE (pcDNA3.1-MK2EE), were reported earlier (30, 31). Constitutively active MKK6, MKK6EE (pcDNA3-MKK6EE) (32), was a gift from R. Davis. In a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, firefly luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency using Renilla activity. Firefly luciferase reporter gene assays were performed as described previously (27). Renilla activity was measured by using a Glomax microplate reader (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and 20 μl of lysate, injecting 100 μl of 1× Renilla substrate buffer (100 mM phosphate buffer [pH 7.8], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 4 μM coelenterazine [Promega]) into the microplate reader, and reading for 10 s after a 2-s delay. In other experiments, cells were cotransfected with pCMV-Gal (CMV stands for cytomegalovirus, and Gal stands for β-galactosidase) as an internal reference. The β-galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (26). A c-Myc-tagged Egr-1 expression vector was generated by cloning PCR-generated murine Egr-1 cDNA into pcDNA3.1(-)-myc-His (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) using the forward (F) 5′-CTG TCA GAA TTC ATG GCA GCG GCC AAG GCC GAG-3′ and reverse (R) 5′-CTG TCA AAG CTT GCA AAT TTC AAT TGT CCT GGG-3′ primers. To generate a −263 SERCA2 promoter construct mutated at putative Sp1 and Egr-1 binding sites A, B, and/or C, nucleotides GAGG were changed to TATA (A and B) and nucleotides CGCC were changed to TATA (C) as indicated in Fig. 5F, by using the Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England BioLabs GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A −3.0 promoter reporter construct of the murine PGC-1α was generated with the F 5′-CTG TCA ACG CGT GTC TGT CAG CCC TTG TAA TGT G-3′ and R 5′-CTG TCA AGA TCT CCA GCT CCC GAA TGA CGC CAG TCA A-3′ primer pair. Fig 5 MK2/3 ablation and shMK2 knockdown increased SERCA gene expression via reduced MK2 activity-dependent Egr-1 function.

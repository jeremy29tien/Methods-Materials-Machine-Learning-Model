COS7, A549, HEK293T, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; pH 7.3) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2.2 g/liter NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. For luciferase assays and small interfering RNA (siRNA), reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), protein half-life, and immunofluorescence experiments, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For SUMOylation analysis, immunoprecipitation, and pulldown assays, the polyethylenimine (Polysience, Inc.) reagent was used.

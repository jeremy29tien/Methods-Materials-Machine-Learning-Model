Human hepatic (Huh7), human monocytic (THP1), and monkey kidney fibroblast (COS7) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Huh7 and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% penicillin-streptomycin in 10-cm2 dishes at 37°C and 5% CO2. THP1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS and 2% penicillin-streptomycin. THP1 differentiation into macrophages was induced using 100 nM phorbol-12-myristate acetate (PMA) for 72 h. For analysis of miR-33a and -a* expression, Huh7 cells were plated in DMEM containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) and treated with native low-density lipoprotein (nLDL; 120 μg/ml) or simvastatin (5 μM) for 24 h. For analysis of miR-33b and -b* expression, Huh7 cells were plated in DMEM containing 10% FBS and stimulated with 10 μM T090 for 12 h.

HEK293T and HEK293E cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg of penicillin and streptomycin/ml (all from Gibco). Where indicated, the cells were treated with 50 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Calbiochem) or exposed to UV irradiation for 90 s using a standard cell culture UV lamp or for 5 min using Stratalinker2400 (254 nm; 100 J/m2; Stratagene). Anti-eEF1A (recognizing both eEF1A1 and eEF1A2), anti-stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK, anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr15), and anti-Myc-tag polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Monoclonal antibodies anti-Myc (9E10), anti-Rpn2, and anti-rpS6 were from Santa Cruz; anti-eIF4E and anti-RACK1 from BD Transduction Laboratories; and anti-β-actin and anti-FLAG were from Sigma-Aldrich. Polyclonal mouse anti-eEF1A2 and polyclonal rabbit anti-eEF1A1 were from Abnova. Polyclonal rabbit anti-JNK antibody that was used in coimmunoprecipitation experiments was obtained from Santa Cruz. Antibodies against S358 of eEF1A2 were generated and affinity-purified using corresponding phosphopeptide (Phosphosolution).

The open reading frame (ORF) of the bait protein was amplified by PCR using the relevant human cDNA constructs and introduced into pDONR2.1. The DNA sequence of the amplified ORF was verified and introduced into a GATEWAY-compatible plasmid, pCDNA5/FRT/TO. All proteins except for menin were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the N terminus. cDNA constructs for Wdr5, Dpy30, Rbbp5, and Ash2l (short isoform) were kindly provided by Ali Shilatifard, and Bod1 cDNA was a kind gift from Jason Swedlow. Human Pa1 and Cfp1 and mouse Wdr82 and Ptip cDNAs were obtained from Source Bioscience (Cfp1, catalog no. IRATp970F0412D; Wdr82, IRCKp5014J0617Q; Pa1, IRAUp969E1119D; Ptip1, IRAV9968G04124D). Stable doxycycline-inducible cell lines were created by transfecting pCDNA5/FRT/TO and pOG44 into HeLa FRT cells carrying the TET repressor using polyethyleneimine followed by antibiotic selection. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with high glucose supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and l-glutamine (all from Lonza) under blasticidin and hygromycin B selection. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 Î¼g/ml doxycycline to the culture medium 16 h prior to cell harvesting. Expression of the proper-sized GFP fusion protein was validated by immunoblotting and by fluorescence microscopy. Bap18-GFP bacterial artificial chromosomes were stably transfected in HeLa cells and selected using Geneticin (G418; Gibco).

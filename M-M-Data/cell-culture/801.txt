Leukocytes were obtained from healthy blood donors. CD4+ T cells were isolated by negative selection using the CD4+ T cell Isolation Kit II from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, CA) and cultured with tosylactivated magnetic beads (1.5 × 105 beads/well) conjugated either with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and IgG or with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and anti-PD-1 MAbs, as previously described (20). Preparation of Dynabeads M-450 (Invitrogen) tosylactivated magnetic beads was done as previously described. Briefly, the following MAbs were used: anti-CD3 (UCHT1; R&D Systems, Inc.), anti-CD28 (CD28.2; Biolegend), agonist anti-human PD-1 (clone 17 [21], kindly provided by Pfizer Inc., Cambridge, MA), and control IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Magnetic beads (2 × 108) were coated with anti-CD3 (8%) and anti-CD28 (10%), and either anti-PD-1 (anti-PD-1/CD3/CD28) or control IgG (IgG/CD3/CD28) comprised the remaining 82% of the total protein. All incubations were performed in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer for 18 h at 37°C with constant rotation. The beads were then washed 3 times and stored at 4°C. In some experiments, T cells were cultured with tosylactivated magnetic beads coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 MAbs, along with PD-L1–IgG2a fusion protein (kindly provided by Gordon Freeman, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) in order to induce PD-1-mediated signaling via interaction with its natural ligand instead of anti-PD-1 agonist antibody. For inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent degradation in the proteasome pathway, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (30 nM) or vehicle control was added for the last 6 h in cultures incubated with anti-CD3/CD28/PD-1-coated beads, and analysis for PTEN expression was performed. DNA synthesis was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation for the last 16 to 18 h of a 72-hour culture.

The in vivo carboxymethylation assay was performed as described previously (26, 27). At 8 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were incubated in labeling medium (90% methionine-free and 10% complete DMEM) containing 10% dialyzed FBS and 0.1 mCi/ml of l-[methyl-3H]methionine for 20 h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysates. To analyze the carboxymethylation of palmitoylated proteins, infected Sf9 cells were starved in labeling medium (95% methionine-free and 5% complete Grace's medium) containing 10% dialyzed FBS. At 3 h after starvation, 0.1 mCi/ml of l-[methyl-3H]methionine was added and cells were incubated for 30 h. Palmitoylated proteins of interest were purified by Ni-NTA agarose, followed by acyl-RAC as described above. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was then stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB). The bands of interest were excised and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Methyl-esterified proteins were analyzed by an alkali hydrolysis/diffusion assay as described previously (26, 27).

The human colon cell line Caco-2/15, obtained from Andrea Quaroni (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), and the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6, provided by the ATCC (Manassas, VA), were cultured as described previously (22). IEC-6 cells were serum starved for 24 h and then treated with 10 ng/ml of interleukin 6 (IL-6) (Bioshop, Burlington, ON, Canada) or 12.5 Î¼g/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (serotype O111:B4; Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY).

K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and antibiotic/antimycotic at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were transfected with a total of 2.0 μg of small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Nucleofector V (Amaxa) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All siRNAs were from Dharmacon. The siRNA sequences are as follows: for αCP(1/2)-1, GUG AAA GGC UAU UGG GCA A; for αCP(1/2)-2, UGU AAG AGU GGA AUG UUA A; for GLD2-1, GUG AUU AAG AAG UGG GCA A; and for GLD2-2, CCA AAG AUA AGU UGA GUC A. Standard control siRNA for cyclophilin was directly purchased from Dharmacon. At 24 h after the initial siRNA transfection, these cells were retransfected with same siRNA. Cells were harvested 72 h after the initial transfection, and RNAs were purified using an Absolutely RNA Miniprep kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (27, 34).

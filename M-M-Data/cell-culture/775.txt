HEK-293, HEK-293T, and HepG2 cell lines were grown and maintained as previously described (48). C2C12 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and cultured at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 10% CO2. The plasmids employed were as follows: pSV HA-PGC-1α, pCDNA flag-PGC-1α (can be purchased via Addgene), pLenti6 PGC-1α pCDNA3 EGFP, pCDNA3 EGFP-PGC-1α, pEFIRES-NQO1, pCDNA3 NQO1/Y128V/Y128F, and pCDNA3 HA-p73β. Transient transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate method.

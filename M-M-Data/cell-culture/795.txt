Murine liver AML12 cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown with a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), insulin-transferrin-selenium-G supplements (Life Technologies), 100 nmol/liter of dexamethasone (Dex; Wako Pure Chemical), 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. For RNA preparation, 5 × 105 AML12 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. Media were changed to a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. The cells were incubated with CDDO-Im for 24 h, Dex or dbcAMP was added, and cells were incubated further for 6 h. For the transfection experiments, 1 × 105 AML12 cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Media were changed to 0.5 ml of a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were then transfected with G6pc-Luc2P, hCREB-A-pF9A, and mNrf2-pcDNA3 using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagent (Life Technologies) for 24 h. For stable transfection, 2 × 106 AML12 cells were seeded in a 100-mm dish. These cells were transfected with G6pc-Luc2P and were selected by 600 μg/ml of hygromycin B (Life Technologies).

Cells were cultured as previously described (3) and treated with 2.5 mg/ml tunicamycin, 300 nM rapamycin, or 60 Î¼M chloroquine or were depleted of amino acids by culturing in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (10 mM glucose, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.45 mM KCl, 120 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM NaH2PO4, 15 mM NaHCO3) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The acquisition, culture, and depletion and overexpression of Upf1/Rent1 and Upf2/Rent2 retroviruses have been previously reported (3, 5). The LKO.1 shATF4 virus (TRCN0000013573) was obtained from Sigma, and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 fusion, a kind gift from G. Kroemer, was cloned into the retroviral vector pQXCIN or pBABE and used to infect U2OS, HCT116, and mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells using standard retroviral generation and infection techniques (3, 5).

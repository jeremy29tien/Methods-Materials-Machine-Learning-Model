Human glioma cell lines T98G (CRL-1690; ATCC) and U87MG (CRL-11268; ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and penicillin (100 U/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Gibco). Glioma cell lines were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium (SFM) according to the manufacturer's protocol. On attaining semiconfluence, cells were switched to SFM and after 4 h, cells were pretreated with quercetin or the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor {"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"LY294002","term_id":"1257998346","term_text":"LY294002"}}LY294002 for 2 h and subsequently cotreated in the presence or absence of TNF-α (50 ng/ml) in SFM. Dimethyl sulfoxide-treated cells were used as controls. For hypoxia treatment, cells were exposed to 2%hypoxia (2%O2, 5%CO2, 93%N2) in a preprogrammed Anoxomat Mark II chamber (MART Microbiology, Drachten, Netherlands) for 24 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems. {"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"LY294002","term_id":"1257998346","term_text":"LY294002"}}LY294002 was purchased from Calbiochem.

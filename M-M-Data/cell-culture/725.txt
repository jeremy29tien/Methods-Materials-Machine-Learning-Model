Cells were cultured at 37°C under conditions of humidified air (5% CO2). Human HEK293, HeLa, PC-3, and MEF MEK5−/− cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics, and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in DMEM F-12 Ham containing 15% FBS and antibiotics. HEK293, HeLa, and PC3 cells were transfected using polyethyleneimine as described before (68). MEF MEK5−/− cells (kindly provided by Cathy Tournier) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM medium supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine. Three hours after transfection, the medium was changed to DMEM. Unless otherwise stated, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1% [wt/vol] NP-40, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium-β-glycerophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 M sucrose, 0.1% [vol/vol] 2-mercaptoethanol, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 12 min at 4°C, and supernatants were stored at −20°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (69).

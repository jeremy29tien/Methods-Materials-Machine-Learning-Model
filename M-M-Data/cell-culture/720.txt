Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were expressed from the U6 promoter in the pBluescript vector (34). The sequences targeted by the short hairpin RNAs were GGGCCATGGCACGTACGGCAA (green fluorescent protein [GFP] control), GGGAGGTTTTGTCAGCCACAC (Sp3-1), and GGGACCAACAACATCAAGAAG (Sp3-2). Wild-type (wt) Flag-Sp3 or Flag-Sp3 bearing the K539R (KR) mutation at the major SUMO acceptor site was expressed from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in pRC-Flag-Sp3. Flag-Sp3 wt and Flag-Sp3 KR were mutated to become resistant to Sp3-1 interfering RNA (RNAi) (GGGAGGTgTTaTCAGCCACAC [lowercase letters indicate mutations]). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% synthetic fetal serum (Fetal Clone II) at 37°C. HeLa cells were cotransfected with 0.75 μg shRNA and 0.2 μg pBABEpuro plasmids/2 × 105 cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Total protein or RNA was isolated after 60 h of selection with 1 μg/ml of puromycin (Calbiochem). For RNAi rescue, cotransfection with 0.5 to 1 μg of Flag-Sp3 RNAi-resistant constructs or an empty vector was performed. Where indicated, either 50 μM 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB; Sigma) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added 8 h before cells were harvested for ChIP or 8 h to 20 h before harvesting for mRNA analysis. For flow cytometry analysis, cells transfected with shRNAs as described above were harvested by trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed overnight in 70% ethanol. Before cell sorting, cells were washed with PBS, treated with RNase A, and stained with 20 μg/ml of propidium iodide. Cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur instrument.

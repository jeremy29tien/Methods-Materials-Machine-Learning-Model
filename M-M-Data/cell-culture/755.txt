HeLa cells and FA-J (EUFA30-F) mutant and corresponding wild-type cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine at 37°C in 5% CO2. Immortalized fibroblast lines FA-A (PD220) and FA-D2 (PD20) and their respective corrected cells, provided by the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund, were grown in the same medium as HeLa cells, but supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml puromycin. The HCC1937 line, which carries a hypomorphic mutation in BRCA1, and the corresponding BRCA1-reconstituted cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. For FANCJ or MRE11 knockdown, a FANCJ-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) or MRE11 siRNA (100 nM; Dharmacon) was transfected into HeLa cells by use of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. After two transfections on consecutive days, cells were harvested 48 h after the second transfection. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-vector, GFP-FANCJ, mCherry-vector, or mCherry-MRE11 plasmid DNA (2 μg) was used to transfect different cell lines, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). FA-J null cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding GFP-FANCJ or with vector by use of a Nucleofector kit (Lonza) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

C3H10T1/2 cells (CCL-226; ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum at 37Â°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The cells, in 60-mm dishes, were cotransfected with plasmids encoding Dlx2, Lhx6, Lhx8, Snail, Sp3, or Lef1 and pCMV-FLAG-Msx1 or with plasmids encoding Dlx2, Lhx6, Lhx8, Snail, Sp3, or Lef1 and pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene) using FuGene 6 reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 36 h, C3H10T1/2 cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (Roche), and proteins were immunoprecipitated by using EZview red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel beads (Sigma). For Western blotting of eluted proteins, polyclonal antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution of primary antibodies against transcription factor Dlx2, Lhx6, Lhx8, Snail, Sp3, or Lef1 (Santa Cruz) or a 1:1,000 dilution of mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Fisher). All coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were independently performed three times, and representative blots are shown.

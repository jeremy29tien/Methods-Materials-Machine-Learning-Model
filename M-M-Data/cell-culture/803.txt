Primary C cell adenocarcinoma cell lines were derived as described previously (15). MEFs were prepared from embryonic day 10.0 (E10.0) or E12.5 embryos derived by intercrossing Rb+/−; ATM+/− or Rb+/−; Ink4a−/− mice. The 3T3 protocol (3-day transfer, inoculum of 3 × 105 cells) assay was performed as described previously (15).

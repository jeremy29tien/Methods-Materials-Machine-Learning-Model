Twelve hundred base pairs of the 3′ UTR of human CYP19A1 and 500 bp of the 3′ UTR of the human GCM1 were amplified from placental genomic DNA and cloned downstream of luciferase in the p-MIR-REPORT miRNA reporter vector (Applied Biosystems). JEG3 cells maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were transfected with either the empty pMIR-REPORT luciferase plasmid (LUC) or with LUC containing the 3′ UTR of the CYP19A1 or hGCM1 gene (LUC-CYP19A1 or LUC-GCM1) with or without the mutated miRNA response element (MRE) (LUC-CYPmut or LUC-GCMmut). Nontargeting control (NTC) or miRNA mimics of miR-19b or miR-106a and a plasmid expressing beta-galactosidase (β-Gal) to correct for transfection efficiency were cotransfected. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and luciferase and β-Gal activities were measured. The mutation of the MRE site in placenta-specific hCYP19 3′ UTR was generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

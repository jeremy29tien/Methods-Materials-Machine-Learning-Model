To generate bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), bone marrow was flushed out from the femurs of one mouse in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and cultured on bacterial grade plastic for 7 days in BMDM medium (Dulbecco modified Eagle medium [DMEM] supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 ng/ml recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor [mCSF]). Cells were then detached by scraping in Versene (Invitrogen) and replated on tissue culture plastic in BMDM medium. For inhibitor studies, cells were treated with either 500 nM INCB-018424 (ruxolitinib), 10 μM SB-747651A, 2 μM PD184352, 5 μM SB 203580, or 10 μM PF3644022 for 1 h before stimulation. Details of the selectivity of these inhibitors have been published previously (27, 36–38). Cells were stimulated with either 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma), 2 μM CpG (ODN 1826), 10 μg/ml poly(I·C), or 100 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-10. When required, actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) was used to inhibit transcription.

All of the reagents used in this study were from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY), unless indicated otherwise. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from NvAMD subjects homozygous for rs1049331 and rs2293870 or age-matched unaffected controls were collected and genotyped as described above. Cultures were maintained in Iscove's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza, Walkersville, MD). Primary adult human choroidal endothelial cells (CECs; a generous gift from Mary Elizabeth Hartnett, University of Utah) were seeded on tissue culture dishes coated with 0.2% gelatin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and maintained in medium 199 (M199) supplemented with 20% bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 μg/ml heparin, 12 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Hammond Cell Tech, Windsor, CA), 100 U/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin C (Gemini Bioproducts, West Sacramento, CA). For all experiments, CECs from passages 2 to 8 were used. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 4.5 g/ml d-glucose and 10% FBS. For transient overexpression of recombinant HtrA1, 2 × 106 HEK 293T cells were transfected with 8 μg pCINeo-encoded constructs by using Trans-IT 293 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's recommendation.

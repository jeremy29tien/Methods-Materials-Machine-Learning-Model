Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) were cultured from mouse pulmonary artery explants as previously described (18), using pulmonary arteries obtained from wild-type (WT), Bmpr2flox/flox, Acvr2a−/−, or compound Bmpr2flox/flox:Acvr2a−/− mice. Isolated PASMC were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), glutamine, and antibiotics (GIBCO-Invitrogen).

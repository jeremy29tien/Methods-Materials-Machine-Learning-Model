Human 293T, human Phoenix, mouse NIH 3T3, and human HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco BRL) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human NALM6 pre-B cell and mouse A70 pre-B cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL) containing 10% FBS (HyClone), 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Pre-B cells were cultured as described previously (36). B220+ cells were isolated from mouse BM using B220-labeled magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech). Purified cells were overlaid onto an irradiated S17 stromal cell layer. The cells were maintained in pre-B cell medium (Opti-MEM medium [Gibco] containing 15% FBS, 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 ng/ml interleukin-7 [IL-7] [R&D Systems]). Cells were passaged every 3 days onto a new S17 stromal cell layer.

Peritoneal macrophages were isolated as described previously (5). Whole-cell extracts were prepared in a lysis buffer (26) and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-Nrf2 (27), anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-HA (Roche), and anti-Î±-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. Cell viability after 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) treatment was determined using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojin Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Diethyl maleate (DEM) and CDNB were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals. Menadione and benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

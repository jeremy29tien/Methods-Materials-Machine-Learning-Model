Cells and cell lines were obtained as follows: human neonatal primary melanocytes (used in most experiments involving melanocytes) from Invitrogen; human melanocytes (see Fig. 1B) and short-term melanoma cultures YULAC, YUSAC, YUGEN8, YURIF, 501mel, and YULIZ from YSPORE, Yale University; WM3918 cells from the Wistar Institute; and SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-103, A375, M14, MeWo, primary foreskin fibroblasts (PFFs), and HCT116 cells from the American Type Culture Collection. All cell lines were maintained as recommended. Normal skin, melanocytic nevus, and melanoma samples were provided by the UMass Cancer Center Tissue Bank and the Skin Pathology Laboratory, Boston University School of Medicine. For BRAFV600E/MEL-ST cells, immortalized but nontransformed human MEL-ST cells (provided by Robert Weinberg) were transduced with a BRAFV600E-expressing retrovirus, pBABE-Blast-BRAFV600E (constructed by cloning BRAFV600E from pBABE-Puro-BRAFV600E [Addgene] into pBABE-BLAST [Addgene]), with 10 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) and selected with blasticidin. HCT116/HN5 cells were kindly provided by Mark Meuth. Fig 1 MEN1 expression is frequently lost in human melanomas and melanoma cell lines. (A and B) qRT-PCR analysis monitoring the expression of MEN1 in human melanocytes, normal skin, melanocytic nevi, and melanoma samples (A) and in human short-term melanoma ... For gamma irradiation treatment, cells were gamma irradiated with 20 Gy for 6 h unless otherwise noted. For ATM/ATR inhibitor treatment, cells were treated with 10 μM CGK733 (Calbiochem) (15) for 2 to 6 h (see Fig. 5B and ​andF)F) or 2 h (see Fig. 7B). Ethanol or estradiol (Sigma) was added to the medium at a concentration of 300 nM 45 min before the fixation of cells (see Fig. 8B and ​andCC and ​and9C9C to ​toE).E). Ethanol or fulvestrant (also called ICI 182,780; Tocris Bioscience) was added to the medium at a concentration of 1 μM at 24 h (see Fig. 8D) or 48 h (see Fig. 8E) before the harvesting of cells. Fig 5 MEN1 is phosphorylated by ATM/ATR and stabilized following DNA damage. (A) (Left) Schematic of the MEN1 protein and sequence alignment of putative ATM/ATR phosphorylation sites (SQ motifs) in different species. The wild-type (WT) and mutant MEN1 protein ... Fig 7 Mutant forms of MEN1 are unable to stimulate the transcription of HR target genes and promote HR-directed DNA repair. Immunoblot analysis monitoring levels of wild-type (WT) and mutant MEN1 proteins following ectopic expression in SK-MEL-28 cells. (B) ... Fig 8 MEN1 and MLL are recruited to the BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1 promoters by ESR1. (A) qRT-PCR analysis monitoring the expression of BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1 in melanocytes expressing an NS, MEN1, ESR1, MLL, or PSIP1 shRNA. Expression was normalized to ... Fig 9 DNA damage and estradiol promote MEN1-dependent expression of BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1. (A) qRT-PCR analysis monitoring the expression of BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1 in melanocytes expressing an NS, MEN1, or ATM shRNA and treated in the presence or absence ...

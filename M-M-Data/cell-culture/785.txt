E13.5 embryos from staged CD1 pregnant mice were collected, and their brains were recovered in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 0.7% glucose and 2.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.3). Brains were embedded in 4% low-melting-point agarose (Invitrogen) in HBSS, followed by preparation of 250-μm coronal slices of the forebrain by using a Leica VT1000S vibratome. Slices were collected on Nuclepore Track-Etched polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes (8.0-μm pores; Whatman Schleicher & Schuell) floating in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glucose, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Slices were incubated at 37°C for 2 h prior to nucleic acid injection and electroporation. DNA plasmids (1 μg/μl) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) reagents (10 μM; Ambion) were mixed with Fast green dye and injected into the neocortical VZ. The ratio of effector nucleic acids (i.e., plasmids encoding IκBαM, IKKβ-DN, RelA, or FLAG-Hes6 or RelA or scrambled siRNA reagents) to GFP expression plasmid was kept at 4:1 to ensure that GFP-expressing cells also expressed the effector protein. This approach normally results in overlapping delivery of the two plasmids in greater than 90% of the electroporated cells (19). Electroporations were performed using a TSS20 Ovodyne electroporator (Intracel) as described previously (19), with the following settings: three pulses (25 V, 5-ms width), 500-ms interval between pulses, zero resistance, boost option selected. Electroporated slices on polycarbonate membranes were transferred to neurobasal medium supplemented with 1% B27, 1% glucose, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% glutamine. Electroporated slices were incubated at 37°C for either 48 h (loss-of-function experiments) or 96 h (RelA overexpression experiments), followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, cryoprotection, and embedding in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek) for sectioning on a cryostat (16 μm). Double-labeling immunofluorescence analysis of the expression of GFP and markers of undifferentiated neural progenitors or postmitotic neurons was performed as described above for embryonic brain sections. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFP (1/500), rabbit anti-Pax6 (1/500), rabbit anti-activated caspase-3 (1/200; BD Pharmingen), mouse anti-Ki-67 (1/200; BD Pharmingen), mouse anti-intermediate filament protein nestin (1/10), mouse anti-βIII-tubulin (1/1,000), mouse anti-MAP2 (1/500; Sigma), mouse anti-NeuN (1/400; Millipore), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (1/250; Sigma), and goat anti-Sox2 (1/500) antibodies. Two to four days after electroporation, sections were subjected to double-label immunofluorescence and quantitation of the percentage of GFP-positive cells that were also positive for the expression of Ki-67, nestin, MAP2, or NeuN. In each experiment, an average of 5 or 6 slices were electroporated and analyzed for expression of the different markers mentioned above.
